# Deidentifying Data
Deidentifying data, sometimes called masking,  is defined by Immuta as: "Data de-identification is a 
form of dynamic data masking that refers to breaking the link between data and the individual 
with whom the data is initially associated. Essentially, this requires removing or transforming 
personal identifiers. Once personal identifiers are removed or transformed using the data 
de-identification process, it is much easier to reuse and share the data with third parties.."

* It is a growing area of provided offerings. Most cloud providers and cloud centric data companies have offerings in this space now. 
In addition to this there are numerous offerings available, from libraries to technology platforms that range from open source to freemium 
  (Some are free, and some are paid within technologies). Our goal and intent is to be a "powered by" technology platform that can be molded 
  like clay, for benefit groups from testing to data integration to application development.
* Our efforts are designed around a very flexible computational data model that can. Our initial focus for the first several years was on 
  enabling massive amounts of extensible data to be used quickly for many needs. Why should organizations risk <a href="https://www.breachlevelindex.com/"

  potential leakage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_health_information" target="_blank">PHI (in healthcare)</a>
  or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data" target="_blank">PII (In any other industry)</a>?
