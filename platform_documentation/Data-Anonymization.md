# Background
De-identification and anonymization are becoming more and more critical for organizations. Data is what powers organizations and 
whether your are working in highly regulated industries or not, it is critical to protect PII(Personally Identifiable Information) and
whatever other specific data needs your regulated industry might have. For those in healthcare, here is a specific 
[standard](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-identification/index.html) that
provide direction and specific details.

## Key Terms and Definitions
The key terminologies and definitions for the platform are:

- Application: Source application where data is provided 
- Organization: Source Organization where data is provided
- Industry Std: Industry Std to leverage, this covers all scenarios including flat files
- Data Type / Message Type: This can be anything from a specific data type or message type (if industry stds are involved)
- PersonIdentity Attributes: Based on the implementation the specific data attributes combined to make a person identity. 
It can be changed at anytime; however, so will the generated metadata within the platform just making any existing personidentity invalid
- PersonIdentity: The generated internal value produced within the Defianz platform based on the personidentity attributes 
presented to the platform for value creation.
- Cross Data Mappings: This is the mapping from source fields to target fields and needs to include the synthetic data attributes 
involved when the data is mapped.

## Key Processes
The following are key processes.

* Identities: Creation of a Unique Idenifier for Input Data
The first tier component in the Defianz platform is to create a unique identificatier for any persons data passing through it.
This process deals with how the platform identifies data records presented to it. 
  * The exposed API endpoint will take the following specific implementataion defined attributes: application, organization and 
  all Person Identity attributes (as one specific string) which the API creates a specific mathematical value for. While the 
  platform persists the application and organization values it only persists the created mathmatical value created from all
  the values sent in. 
  <b> If anything changes in the implementation including something as small as extra spaces or adding new data elements 
  the key created will be DIFFERENT and this process will produce a different identifier and any existing relationships will not
  exist </b>
* Cross Data Mappings: Involve three key aspects
  * Record Identifier: This is done by a user through the web interface and intended to be a place for all activities
  related to a specific application and organization.
  * Record Identifier Mapping: This is user driver so the platform know what specific fields in the data stream
  will be mapped to what specific data attribute the platform has.
  * Data Association: This is done by the API based on the record identifer mapping and some logic. The
    mapping tells the platform what data attributes to use and the API goes and retrieves random data to complete
    the request. The values (not the specific data) are then persisted to meet the mapping requirements.
    * If there is NO data associattion the platform will go and get the needed data to fulfill the mapping requirement 
    and persist the ids of what it retrieved for future consistency and reuse. If there is data associated the API simply 
    returns the data


# Deidentifying Data
Deidentifying data, sometimes called masking, is defined by Immuta as: "Data de-identification is a 
form of dynamic data masking that refers to breaking the link between data and the individual 
with whom the data is initially associated. Essentially, this requires removing or transforming 
personal identifiers. Once personal identifiers are removed or transformed using the data 
de-identification process, it is much easier to reuse and share the data with third parties.."

In addition to this there are numerous offerings available, from libraries to technology platforms that range from open source to freemium 
  (Some are free, and some are paid within technologies). Our goal and intent is to be a "powered by" technology platform that can be molded 
  like clay, for benefit groups from testing to data integration to application development.

# Anonymizing Data
Anonymizing data is defined by TechTarget as: "Data anonymization describes various techniques 
to remove or block data containing personally identifiable information (PII). Data anonymization 
promotes data privacy while maintaining the integrity and usefulness of the overall data set.
This approach supports analysis and research without revealing the identity of any subjects involved."
