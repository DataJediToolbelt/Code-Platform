# Platform - Legacy (Non-Python)
In order to best explain how the Synthetic Data Platform works we have created content
that explains it. Please start <a href="./Platform-Areas.md" target="_blank">here</a>.

## APIs - Legacy (Non-Python)
Specific artifacts related to the platform's provided APIs. It should be noted that most of the APIs need refactoring as the data model
itself was completely refactored to help simplify it and provide greater extensibility for the future.

## User Interfaces - Legacy
While there are projects listed, these are aspirational, as we need to refactor the APIs and reimagine the capabilities we want overall.
