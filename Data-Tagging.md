# Tagging Data
Tagging data is defined as: "the process of adding labels, or metadata, to data to help 
identify, categorize, and potentially protect it." This is becoming a very important field within various areas of data
analysis and architecture. Here is [[one sites](https://blogs.sas.com/content/datamanagement/2020/01/09/4-data-tagging-best-practices/) take on data tagging.

# Our Tagging Guiding Principles 
- Tokenization is involved in the tagging process to try and ensure we mitigate as much original data as we can.
- Tagging is configurable and tunable. Our initial work will be focused on creating the basic tagging capabilities and moving into more advanced
  rules based processes.
-  Any data that is tagged will ALWAYS be associated with applications and organizations and source as defined within the platform. This is
intended to support consistency and extensibility for business or user needs.
- We have enhanced our data model to support the storage of what reference data was used 
and the tags it built. *We will only store the bare minimum needed to ensure that we can address questions or concerns.*
